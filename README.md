# Python-Socket-Wrapper
A wrapper class for the python socket with automatic type deduction.


I was using python during work and had to use sockets. Seeing as how python should be a high level language I was utterly dumbfounded that python sockets expects you to know how big something is in bytes. I found pythons support for raw data very diffuse but in the end ended up with this.
